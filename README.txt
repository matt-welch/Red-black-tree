Section Number: TODO
Language: C++
Compilation instructions: 
	Navigate to the directory containing the source code and Makefile.  Type "make" at the shell prompt
	to make the default target, the binary file "run".  Executing the command "make clean" will remove 
	all binaries and *.o files from the directory if desired.

README TODO::
You program should be well documented. At the start of each function, you should inform the
reader what this function is about and what algorithm(s) you are using.

Sample input and output files are posted at the class website.
Grading:
• Makefile: 10 pts
You should have a file named main.c and a file named RBtree.c You may also have necessary
header files as you see fit. The makefile should correctly set the dependencies, and compile
the executable named ”run”.
• Data Types: 10 pts
• Driver: 20 pts
• Input/Output: 20 pts
• Tree Insertion: 20 pts
• Tree Deletion: 20 pts
• No credit will be given if your program does not compile on general.asu.edu or cannot be
executed on that machine. This is not an easy project. So you should start early. In addition
to the red-black tree operations, you need to learn to use Makefile. you need to learn how to
open/close a file and I/O with files.
