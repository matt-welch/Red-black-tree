Compilation instructions: 
	Navigate to the directory containing the source code and Makefile.  Type "make" at the shell prompt
	to make the default target, the binary file "run".  Executing the command "make clean" will remove 
	all binaries and *.o files from the directory if desired.  Executing the command "make debug" will 
	change the g++ flags to "-g3 -ggdb -O0 -Wall -pedantic -DDEBUG" and make the binary "run".
